Define the size of the data type you want to use.
Make sure you have default values.
If users want the datatype to have a size that can be modified,
have a range defining the possible size of the data type.

Ex: <2,6>. 2 is the minimum amount of bytes, 6 is the maximum. If the field is blank, we are allowed to go to 0
for the min and infinity for the max.
 If the first field equals the last field, we know the size is constant.

Next pointers, the compiler should be able to figure out what type of pointer we're using so
a ptr data type should do.

To get the value stored in the pointer we can use &. We use this instead of & because & is a bit wise operator.

We might be able to get rid of the while loop and just use a for loop.
