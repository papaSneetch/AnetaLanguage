llvm causes problems for queues when the name variable is the first variable in an object. *Prev = Next overwrites the first element pointer in a queue so it points to the wrong element.

Example Code:
codeObjects.front() -> codeGen(*this);
codeObjects.front().reset();
codeObjects.pop();

Test 3 has problems with the global variable.
Test 9 doesn't include escape characters.

The program jumps from generating code for the pi function to the main function.
The program also prints that the "pi" function was generated when the debugger suggests the line is never encountered.
